## Game Overview
In this endless runner game, the player character moves horizontally from left to right (and potentially vertically up). The map and obstacles are generated procedurally and move toward the player, simulating forward movement.

The objective is to avoid incoming obstacles and keep running as far as possible. It's similar to the concept of **Hole in the Wall**, where you have to dodge objects and walls moving towards you.

## Tech Stack

- **Unreal Engine 5** for game development
- **C++** for core game mechanics
